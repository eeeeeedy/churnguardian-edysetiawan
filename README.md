## Project's Background

**Background:**

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and customer churn is a significant concern. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, predicting customer churn and understanding the underlying reasons can provide invaluable insights for customer retention strategies.

**Problem Statement:**

To develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn in the telecommunications industry with at least 80% recall score, and to segment the identified "at-risk" customers into clusters for targeted retention strategies.

## Datasets

**Dataset Overview:**

- Dataset Source: This dataset is obtained from the Kaggle public dataset
- This dataset contains information about customers in the telecommunications industry, focusing on various attributes that could be indicative of customer churn

## Objectives

- Data Preparation and Exploration: To clean and explore the dataset to understand the variables that influence customer churn.
- Predictive Modeling: To develop a classification model that can predict customer churn with an accuracy of at least 85%.
- Clustering Analysis: To segment the customers predicted as 'Churn' into different clusters based on their characteristics.
- Retention Strategy: To propose targeted retention strategies for each identified cluster.
- Evaluation: To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the proposed retention strategies within a set timeframe (e.g., 3 months).
